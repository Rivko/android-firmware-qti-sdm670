                    The History of PCCTS

         The Purdue Compiler-Construction Tool Set


                        Terence Parr
                 Parr Research Corporation
                   Minneapolis, Minnesota
                            and
                  University of Minnesota
      Army High Performance Computing Research Center

                      [Updated 8-7-94]


     The PCCTS project began as a parser-generator project for a  gra-
duate  course  at Purdue University in the Fall of 1988 taught by Hank
Dietz- translator-writing systems.  Under the  guidance  of  Professor
Dietz, the parser generator, ANTLR (originally called YUCC), continued
after the termination of the course and eventually became the  subject
of  Terence  Parr's Master's thesis.  Originally, lexical analysis was
performed via ALX which was soon replaced by Will Cohen's DLG  in  the
Fall  of  1989 (DFA-based lexical-analyzer generator, also an offshoot
of the graduate translation course).

     The alpha version of ANTLR was  totally  rewritten  resulting  in
1.00B.    Version   1.00B  was  released  via  an  internet  newsgroup
(comp.compilers) posting in February of 1990 and  quickly  gathered  a
large  following.  1.00B generated only LL(1) parsers, but allowed the
merged description of lexical and syntactic analysis.  It had rudimen-
tary  attribute  handling  similar  to that of YACC and did not incor-
porate rule parameters or return values; downward inheritance was very
awkward.   1.00B-generated  parsers  terminated  upon the first syntax
error.  Lexical classes (modes) were not allowed and DLG did not  have
an interactive mode.

     Upon starting his Ph.D. at Purdue in the Fall  of  1990,  Terence
Parr  began  the  second  total rewrite of ANTLR.  The method by which
grammars may be  practically  analyzed  to  generate  LL(k)  lookahead
information  was  discovered in August of 1990 just before his return.
Version 1.00 incorporated this algorithm and included the AST  mechan-
ism,  lexical  classes,  error  classes, and automatic error recovery;
code quality and portability were higher.  In February  of  1992  1.00
was  released  via  an  article in SIGPLAN Notices.  Peter Dahl, Ph.D.
candidate, and Professor Matt O'Keefe (both at the University of  Min-
nesota)  tested  this  version  extensively.  Dana Hoggatt (Micro Data
Base Systems, Inc.) came up with the idea of error  grouping  (strings
attached to non-terminals) and tested 1.00 heavily.

     Version 1.06 was released in  December  1992  and  represented  a
large  feature enhancement over 1.00.  For example, rudimentary seman-
tic predicates were  introduced,  error  messages  were  significantly
improved  for k>1 lookahead and ANTLR parsers could indicate that loo-
kahead fetches were  to  occur  only  when  necessary  for  the  parse



                                                                Page 1

                                                                 PCCTS


(normally,  the  lookahead "pipe" was constantly full).  Russell Quong
joined the project in the Spring of 1992 to aid in the semantic predi-
cate  design.   Beginning  and  advanced  tutorials  were  created and
released as well.  A makefile generator  was  included  that  sets  up
dependencies  and  such  correctly  for  ANTLR and DLG.  Very few 1.00
incompatibilities were introduced (1.00 was quite different from 1.00B
in some areas).

     1.10 was released on August 31, 1993 and incorporated bug  fixes,
a  few  feature enhancements and a major new capability - an arbitrary
lookahead operator (syntactic predicate), (alpha)?beta.  This  feature
was  co-designed with Professor Russell Quong also at Purdue.  To sup-
port infinite lookahead, a preprocessor flag, ZZINF_LOOK, was  created
that  forced the ANTLR() macro to tokenize all input prior to parsing.
Hence, at any moment, an action or predicate can see the entire  input
sentence.   The predicate mechanism of 1.06 was extended to allow mul-
tiple predicates to be hoisted; the syntactic context of  a  predicate
was also moved along with the predicate.

     In February of 1994, SORCERER (a  simple  tree-parser  generator)
was  released.  This tool allows the user to parse child-sibling trees
by specifying a grammar rather than building a recursive-descent  tree
walker  by  hand.   Work  towards a library of tree transformations is
underway.  Aaron Sawdey at The University of Minnesota became a second
author of SORCERER after the initial release.

     On April 1, 1994, PCCTS 1.20 was released.  This  was  the  first
version  to  actively  support C++ output.  It also included important
fixes regarding semantic predicates and (..)+ subrules.  This  version
also introduced token classes, the "not" operator, and token ranges.

     On June 19, 1994, SORCERER 1.00B9 was released.   Gary  Funck  of
Intrepid  Technology  joined the SORCERER team and provided very valu-
able suggestions regarding the "transform" mode of SORCERER.

     On August 8, 1994, PCCTS 1.21 was released.  It mainly cleaned up
the C++ output and included a number of bug fixes.

     From the 1.21 release forward, the maintenance and support of all
PCCTS  tools  will be primarily provided by Parr Research Corporation,
Minneapolis MN---an organization founded on the principles  of  excel-
lence in research and integrity in business; we are devoted to provid-
ing really cool software tools.  Please see file PCCTS.FUTURE for more
information.  All PCCTS tools currently in the public domain will con-
tinue to be in the public domain.

     Looking towards the future, a graphical user-interface is in  the
design  phase.   This  would  allow  users  to view the syntax diagram
representation of their grammars and would highlight  nondeterministic
productions.   Parsing can be traced graphically as well.  This system
will be built using a multiplatform window library.  We  also  antici-
pate  the  introduction  of  a  sophisticated error handling mechanism
called "parser exception handling" in a near future release.

     Currently, PCCTS is used at over 1000 known academic, government,
and  commercial  sites in 37 countries.  Of course, the true number of
users is unknown due to the large number of ftp sites.

Notes on Building PCCTS 1.32 with Borland C++

I have gotten ANTLR and DLG to succesfully build with BCC 4.0, but have found
from experience that ANTLR, in particular, is likely to run out of memory
with grammars over a certain size, or with larger values for the -k and -ck
options.  Now that BCC 4.02 and the new Borland Power Pack for DOS is now
available, I feel that there is no excuse not to build these tools as
32-bit executables, as they ought to be.
 
For people without the Power Pack, the makefiles below should be fairly easily
modified to build 16-bit real-mode executables, but I don't really recommend
it.  As an alternative, you might consider the highly regarded DJGPP compiler
(a DOS port of the Gnu GCC compiler, with a DOS extender included).  Hopefully
some other PCCTS who has DJGPP can provode whatever advice is necessary.  The
Watcom compiler is also an excellent possibility (albeit a commercial one),
and I hope to make available Watcom makefiles in the near future.
 
Here are the makefiles I am using.  Both makefiles use a compiler configuration
file that contains compiler switches such as optimization settings.  I call
this file bor32.cfg and keep a copy in both the ANTLR and DLG subdirectories.

Portions of this software are derived from third-party works licensed
under terms compatible with the above MIT license:

The TRE regular expression implementation (src/regex/reg* and
src/regex/tre*) is Copyright © 2001-2008 Ville Laurikari and licensed
under a 2-clause BSD license (license text in the source files). The
included version has been heavily modified by Rich Felker in 2012, in
the interests of size, simplicity, and namespace cleanliness.

Much of the math library code (src/math/* and src/complex/*) is
Copyright © 1993,2004 Sun Microsystems or
Copyright © 2003-2011 David Schultz or
Copyright © 2003-2009 Steven G. Kargl or
Copyright © 2003-2009 Bruce D. Evans or

and labelled as such in comments in the individual source files. All
have been licensed under extremely permissive terms.

The ARM memcpy code (src/string/armel/memcpy.s) is Copyright © 2008
The Android Open Source Project and is licensed under a two-clause BSD
license. It was taken from Bionic libc, used on Android.

The implementation of DES for crypt (src/misc/crypt_des.c) is
Copyright © 1994 David Burren. It is licensed under a BSD license.

The implementation of blowfish crypt (src/misc/crypt_blowfish.c) was
originally written by Solar Designer and placed into the public
domain. The code also comes with a fallback permissive license for use
in jurisdictions that may not recognize the public domain.

The smoothsort implementation (src/stdlib/qsort.c) is Copyright © 2011
Valentin Ochs and is licensed under an MIT-style license.

The BSD PRNG implementation (src/prng/random.c) and XSI search API
(src/search/*.c) functions are Copyright © 2011 Szabolcs Nagy and
licensed under following terms: "Permission to use, copy, modify,
and/or distribute this code for any purpose with or without fee is
hereby granted. There is no warranty."

The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain. Several files (crt)
were released into the public domain; others are licensed under the
standard MIT license terms at the top of this file. See individual
files for their copyright status.

The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard
Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was adapted
by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during upstream
integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.

The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard Pennington,
and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer. It is licensed
under the standard MIT terms.

All other files which have no copyright comments are original works
produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either
by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more
contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files
can be found in the git version control history of the project. The
omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the
interest of source tree size.

All public header files (include/* and arch/*/bits/*) should be
treated as Public Domain as they intentionally contain no content
which can be covered by copyright. Some source modules may fall in
this category as well. If you believe that a file is so trivial that
it should be in the Public Domain, please contact the authors and
request an explicit statement releasing it from copyright.

The following files are trivial, believed not to be copyrightable in
the first place, and hereby explicitly released to the Public Domain:

All public headers: include/*, arch/*/bits/*
Startup files: crt/*
