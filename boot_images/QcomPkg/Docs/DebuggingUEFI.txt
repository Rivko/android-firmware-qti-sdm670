Debugging UEFI
--------------

Note:
Replace all instance of <TargetPkg> with valid target folder in QcomPkg:
e.g: QcomPkg\<TargetPkg> is "QcomPkg\Msm8996Pkg" or "QcomPkg\SDM845Pkg"

 ---------------------------
| Pre requisites and Setup  |
 ---------------------------

  1) Supported T32 sofware
  2) Startup scripts and shortcuts from the source tree
  3) JTAG connected and Target powered
     - If sys.m.a on Core 0 should be able to establish sync with CPU
  4) Source tree with built binaries including symbols available

| Debugging |
 -----------

  Main UEFI debug scripts are common across all targets and architecture states. Some of the params change per
  target, so the starting scripts are located in the target tools folders. The script instructions hold good for
  both 32-bit and 64-bit UEFI builds. 

  Usage:
    do debug_uefi.cmm [[ram,][rel,][tools,][menu]] [sec|dxe|go|drvr|drvr1,drvr2,drvr2] 

  Optional Arguments: choose any or all of the following options, separated by commas as the first argument 
    REL   :     Debug RELEASE build instead of the DEBUG builds (DEBUG builds debugging is default)
    RAM   :     Load the UEFI binary built from the source tree into RAM and start debugging (without needing to flash)
    TOOLS :     Load the tools binary built from the source tree into RAM and star tusing tools (no need to flash)
    MENU  :     Stop in the BDS menu without needing to press hotkeys or change variables
  
  Modules to debug: specify the modules to debug 
    SEC   :     Debug Sec module and stop at SEC entry point function. If need to debug further modules, then press enter
                in the area window. This also continues to debug Dxe and stops at Dxe entry point
    DXE   :     Debug Dxe module, stop at Dxe entry point as debugging starts
    go    :     Mostly used in conjunction with RAM loading. Load image into RAM and go without needing to load
                any symbols further. This is the fastest way of seeing if things work fine without flashing UEFI.
                Symbols can be loaded later using symbol_load.cmm as needed.
    drvr  :     This is string that can be used to search in the driver name/path to stop and debug.
                For example: "do debug_uefi runtime" would stop at the entry point functions of the drivers 
                CapsuleRuntimeDxe, RuntimeDxe, ResetRuntimeDxe etc. Search is NOT case sensitive.
    mult drvrs: String containing up to 3 comma-separate driver or application names, that each work similar to
                the "drvr" command mentioned above. 


  Debugging using T32 can be done in the following ways
  1) Load the UEFI image into RAM for temporary debugging
     - This method helps when the code changes in development is not proven yet to flash it,
       or just plain to try in easiest way without flashing

     a) In RPM T32 session, cd to QcomPkg\<TargetPkg>\Tools
     b) run command "do debug_uefi.cmm ram"
          Loads the image into ram and continues to debug images by loading symbols as drivers load
     c) run command "do debug_uefi.cmm ram go"
          Loads the image into ram and just runs without loading symbols
     d) run command "do debug_uefi.cmm ram sec"
          Loads the image into ram and load symbols and stop at entry points of Sec and Dxe for debugging
     e) run command "do debug_uefi.cmm ram dxe"
          Loads the image into ram and load symbols and stop at entry point of Dxe for debugging
     e) run command "do debug_uefi.cmm ram test"
          Loads the image into ram and load symbols as drivers load and stop at entry point of 
          the image whose name matches "test" anywhere in the path
     f) run command "do debug_uefi.cmm ram test1,test2,test3"
          Loads the image into ram and load symbols as drivers load and stop at entry point of 
          the images whose names match any of the comma separated arguments, anywhere in the path
     g) run command "do debug_uefi.cmm ram,tools go"
          Loads both UEFI and tools images into ram and continues
     h) run command "do debug_uefi.cmm ram,menu go"
          Loads UEFI image into RAM and automatically stops in BDS menu

  2) The image is flashed to the storage device and debug by loading symbols when interested driver images get loaded
     - In this method, source and built binaries are available for the image that's flashed on the device
     - SBL's load the UEFI image into RAM to execute

     a) In Apps Boot Core T32 session, cd to QcomPkg\<TargetPkg>\Tools
     b) run command "do debug_uefi.cmm sec"
          start debug session by synchronously loading the symbols as drivers load. Stops at entry points of Sec and Dxe
     c) run command "do debug_uefi.cmm dxe"
          start debug session by synchronously loading the symbols as drivers load. Stops at entry point of Dxe
     d) run command "do debug_uefi.cmm test"
          start debug session by synchronously loading the symbols as drivers load. Stops at entry
          point of the image whose name matches "test" anywhere in the path
     e) run command "do debug_uefi.cmm test"
          start debug session by synchronously loading the symbols as drivers load. Stops at entry
          point of the image whose names match any of the comma separated arguements, anywhere in the path

  3) The image is already flashed to the storage device and debug by loading
     all symbols one shot when the target can be stopped (eg in shell) or
     target crashed in UEFI
       - In this method, source and built binaries are available for the image
         that's programmed
       - target is in crashed state in UEFI or is in UEFI doing something

     a) In Apps Boot Core T32 session, 
          - cd to QcomPkg\<TargetPkg>\Tools
          - sys.m.a
          - do symbol_load.cmm


NOTE: Subsequent calls to debug scritps can be made from any directory after executing debug_uefi script from TargetPkg once
