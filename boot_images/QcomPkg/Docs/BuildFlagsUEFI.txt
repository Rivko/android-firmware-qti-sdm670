Creating a merged elf
---------------------
After individual modules are compiled/generated, buildit.py will parse through dsc files and generate a merged elf files based on information parsed. Once the tags are added, there is no additional invocation required to perform merges.

What can be merged?
-------------------
Currently, merging can be done with generated .dll and .fv files.

How to specify merges
---------------------
[Components.common]
  This section is a list of modules needed by the platform. Tags can be added in each module block to denote that this module (.dll) should be merged.
  
  Example:
  [Components.common]
    QcomPkg/SDM845Pkg/Library/XBLRamDumpLib/XBLRamDumpLib.inf {
    # MERGE xbl.elf
    # SIGN sbl1
    # XBL_SEC QcomPkg/SDM845Pkg/Library/XBL_SEC/xbl_sec.mbn
    ...
  }

    
[UserExtensions.Buildit.BuildInfo]
  This section is used when .fv files (generated from an fdf file) need to be merged into an elf.
  
  Example:
  [Defines]
      FLASH_DEFINITION               = QcomPkg/QcomTestPkg/QcomTestPkg.fdf
  ...
  [UserExtensions.Buildit.BuildInfo]
    COMPILER_ARCH = AARCH64
    OUTPUT_NAME   = uefi.elf
    SIGN_FD       = uefi
    MERGE         = xbl.elf
    SIGN          = sbl1

----------------------------
|Tags for Components.common|
----------------------------
Note: Tags in this section must be prepended by '#'.

# BUILD.MERGE value
  Modules that share the same value for MERGE or MERGE_BASE will be merged together. There is no guaranteed order in which images will appear inside the merged elf.

# BUILD.MERGE_BASE value
  Same as MERGE except that this image will be the first image in the elf. If multiple MERGE_BASE tags exist with the same value, this will be treated as an error.
  
# BUILD.SIGN value
  Sign type used to sign the final merged elf. If omitted, sign type defined by another section will be used if defined, otherwise signing will be skipped.
  
# BUILD.XBL_SEC value
  If specifed, this file will be inserted (bit for bit) as a program section into the merged elf and a corresponding program header will be added.
  
-------------------------------------------
|Tags for UserExtensions.Buildit.BuildInfo|
-------------------------------------------
Note: Tags are NOT prepended by '#'.

  COMPILER_ARCH = value
    Architecture that should be used to compile dsc.
  
  OUTPUT_NAME = value
    This will determine the name of the .fv once converted to .elf format.
  
  SIGN_FD = value
    Sign type to be used when signing the resulting .elf. If omitted, the .elf will not be signed.
  
  MERGE = value
    Modules that share the same value for MERGE or MERGE_BASE will be merged together. There is no guaranteed order in which images will appear inside the merged elf.
  
  SIGN = value
     Sign type used to sign the final merged elf. If omitted, sign type defined by another section will be used if defined, otherwise signing will be skipped.
  
  XBL_SEC = value
    If specifed, this file will be inserted (bit for bit) as a program section into the merged elf and a corresponding program header will be added.
