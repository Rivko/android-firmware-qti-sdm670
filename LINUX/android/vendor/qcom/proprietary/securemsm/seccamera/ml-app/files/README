MLVM Demo APP
=================

This App runs on ML VM, processes commands received from HLOS and synchronizes
frame buffers status with hypervisor. HLOS App Commands such as
MLVM_APP_CMD_FRAME_NOTIFICATION are received on every frame event. Whereas,
commands like MLVM_APP_CMD_STOP and MLVM_APP_CMD_HLOS_APP_INIT are once per run.

The basic flow of a single run is as follows

1. Run ML App
2. Initialize socket communication with HLOS App, And wait for
   MLVM_APP_CMD_HLOS_APP_INIT cmd.
3. Wait for start command from HLOS seccamservice. On receiving this cmd,
   open scbuf dev node and poll for POLLPRI events. Receving this event
   signifies that phy lanes are protected, the buffers are unmapped from
   HLOS and mapped to MLVM. Secure usecase can now begin.
4. After receiving Start notification, service the commands from HLOS App. All
   the Frame Events are received at this point.
5. ML App continues to service HLOS commands(Frame events) until it receives
   MLVM_APP_CMD_STOP cmd. On receiving STOP, ML App cleanup is expected and then
   notify hypervisor about the use case completion (notify_hyp_done()). This
   will allow the buffers to be unmaped.
6. Exit the pthread that was servicing HLOS App commands.
7. End use.


API Info:
================

1. MLVM_app_start():
Initialize socket communication with HLOS App.

2. MLVM_app_receive_cmds():
Waits on receiving Init from App and Start notification from hypervisor. On
receiving both, start a pthread (hlos_rcv_cmds()) for receiving commands from
HLOS app. Thread completes on receiving stop command from HLOS App.

3. init_cmd_handler():
Called on receiving MLVM_APP_CMD_HLOS_APP_INIT by wait_for_hlos_app_init_cmd().

4. process_frame():
Called on every frame event received from HLOS seccamservice. The camera_buffer
received is already checked if protected. If the processing time required is
long, buffer can be copied and returned. Return value is sent back to HLOS App
as part of response.

5. stop_cmd_handler():
Called on receiving MLVM_APP_CMD_STOP command from HLOS App. notify_hyp_done()
is called before exiting. This will indicate hypervisor about the session has
ended and buffers are safe to be unmapped.

seccamlib.h API's:

6. wait_for_hlos_app_init_cmd()
API blocks on MLVM_APP_CMD_HLOS_APP_INIT. Optional call. Can be removed if no
init required before starting to receive frame events.

7. wait_for_hyp_notification()
API blocks on Start notification (RES_MGR_NOTIFY_MAPPED_REGION) from hypervisor.
Return MLVM_APP_E_SUCCESS from this API guarantees that the buffers are
protected. If returned MLVM_APP_E_FAIL, there was a failure in receiving message
from the cog driver and the ml app needs to be restarted.

8. notify_hyp_done()
Notifies hypervisor about the completion of secure camera usecase. This allows
the buffers to be unmapped.

9. hlos_rcv_cmds()
Main loop waiting for commands from HLOS. Sends response if the rsp_size is not
null after processCommand(). Breaks on receiving MLVM_APP_E_STOP_COMMAND.

10. processCommand()
Based on the cmd_id received, appropriate function calls are made. Any new
command needs to be added here for handling.

11. frame_notification_handler()
Handler called on receiving MLVM_APP_CMD_FRAME_NOTIFICATION. It Calls
is_buffer_secure() to check if the capture_buffer received is protected and
mmaps the buffer to userspace. Calls process_frame() for further processing.

12. is_buffer_secure()
Sends the frame buffer address to hypervisor to check if it is protected.

13. demoExchangeTimestamp()
Command handler for demonstrating adding new commands. New command can be added
to enum mlvmapp_cmd_id_t, before MLVM_APP_CMD_LAST.


Socket API:
14. sock_init()
Creates a socket of family AF_MSM_IPC, service_id MLAPP_SERVER_SERVICE_ID,
instance 0. Client(HLOS App) looks for this service_id and instance number,
before starting communication.
 
15. sock_wait_for_cmd()
Receives command request from HLOS App.

16. sock_send_response()
Sends respose to the client.
