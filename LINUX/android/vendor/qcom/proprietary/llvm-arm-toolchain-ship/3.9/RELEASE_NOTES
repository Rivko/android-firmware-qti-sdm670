This is the release of Snapdragon LLVM ARM C/C++ compiler toolchain version
3.9.3 for Android. This is a cross toolchain built to run on x86 64-bit Ubuntu 
Linux (versions 10.04 and later).

The Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler will only generate code for ARM targets and 
will not generate code for any of the other targets supported by llvm.org.

Version 3.9.3 of Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler is based off the llvm.org 3.9
release. This Snapdragon LLVM ARM toolchain 3.9.3 release includes proprietary
features and optimizations that are not available in the llvm.org release.

The Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler uses the integrated assembler for assembling
and includes a full featured proprietary linker (QC Linker) for linking.

NOTE: GLIBCXX_3.4.18 or higher is required to run Snapdragon LLVM 3.9 on Ubuntu
x86 64-bit hosts; this library is typically available as part of Ubuntu
distribution or GCC-4.8 x86 distributions. 

For LLVM ARM Compiler documentation requests, please get in touch with your
Qualcomm Android support point of contact.

The following are some of the key features in the 3.9.3 version compared to the
3.8 version:

1. Improved compiler warnings. Please refer to section 4.3.5.1 of the
   Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler User Guide
2. Improved PGO feature with continued emphasis on using profiling for Android
   environments
3. Several optimizations and features targeting baremetal images
   
This 3.9.3 release has been verified to build Android the same way as the 
LLVM toolchain provided by Google does.

Basic Usage & Examples:

clang and clang++ are the C and C++ drivers respectively of Snapdragon
LLVM ARM Compiler. They require users to specify the assembler and linker
explicitly.

For Linux:

Note that clang does not use any sysroot by default. Users need to specify a 
sysroot (such as GCC-4.9.0 sysroot) using the --sysroot option as described in
section 3.9 of the Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler User Guide. 

Examples of clang driver usage on Linux:
clang -march=armv7-a -mfloat-abi=softfp -mfpu=neon -O3 -o foo foo.c
clang++ -mcpu=krait -mfloat-abi=softfp -mfpu=neon -Os -mthumb -o bar bar.cpp
clang++ -mcpu=krait -mfloat-abi=softfp -mfpu=neon \
--sysroot=</path/to/another-gcc-sysroot> -Ofast -c test.cpp

For generating executables that can be executed on ARM Linux and Android
environments, we recommend using the -static linker flag to enable generation
of static executables which do not have dependencies on runtime OS libraries.

Options:

To find out the most common options, please pass the -help flag to the clang
driver. This will report the Snapdragon LLVM ARM specific options and
general ARM options first, before listing target independent options
available in the Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler.

Compiler options for best performance:

For 64-bit applications, we recommend using "-Ofast -mcpu=cortex-a57" options
for best performance on Kryo and Cortex-a57 cores, and "-Ofast
-mcpu=cortex-a53" for best performance on Cortex-a53 cores.

For 32-bit, we recommend using the "-Ofast -mcpu=krait" options for best
performance of your application on Krait cores. For non-Krait 32-bit cores, we
recommend using the "-Ofast" option. If you would like to avoid the generation
of Krait specific instructions (hardware divide, fused-mac) to enable running
on a variety of ARMv7 cores, but still optimize for best performance on Krait
cores, we recommend the "-Ofast -march=armv7-a -mfpu=neon" options.

The -Ofast option enables several high performance optimizations such as
Auto-vectorizer. Please refer to section 4.3.19 of the Snapdragon LLVM ARM
Compiler User Guide for more details.

Compiler options for smallest code-size:

We recommending using the "-Osize -mthumb" options to generate the most compact
code with the Snapdragon LLVM 3.9 compiler. Please refer to section 4.3.19 of 
the Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler User Guide for more details on the -Osize 
optimization level.

Compiling for AArch64:
To compile for AArch64 (ARMv8 64-bit mode), please pass the following option to
clang:
 -target aarch64-linux-gnu

Compiling for AArch32:
To compile for AArch32, please pass the following option to clang:
 -target armv8-linux-gnueabi

Note that even though AArch32 ISA is fully backward compatible with ARMv7 ISA,
there are newer instructions in AArch32 ISA compared to ARMv7 ISA.
This means that AArch32 executables cannot be executed on ARMv7 cores such
as Krait.

Please refer to section 4.3.19 of the Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler User Guide to
learn about various optimization flags.

LLVM's Support for GCC command line options:

Most of the commonly used GCC options are supported by LLVM as well. A detailed
list of options supported is listed in section 4.3 of the Snapdragon LLVM ARM
Compiler User Guide.
