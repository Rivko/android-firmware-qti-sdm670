---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the release of Snapdragon LLVM ARM C/C++ compiler toolchain version
3.8.1. It contains a bug fix over the major release 3.8 described below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Snapdragon LLVM ARM C/C++ compiler toolchain version 3.8 is a cross
toolchain built to run on x86 64-bit Ubuntu Linux (versions 10.04 and later)
and Windows platform (Windows 7 64-bit). This Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler will
generate code only for ARM targets and will not generate code for any of the
other targets supported by llvm.org LLVM.

The version 3.8 of Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler is based off the llvm.org 3.8
release. Snapdragon LLVM ARM toolchain 3.8 release includes proprietary
features and optimizations that are not available in the llvm.org release.

The Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler uses the integrated assembler for assembling
and relies on GNU tools for linking. It also includes a full featured
proprietary linker (QC Linker) for linking.

NOTE: GLIBCXX_3.4.18 or higher is required to run Snapdragon LLVM 3.8 on Ubuntu
x86 64-bit hosts; this library is typically available as part of Ubuntu
distribution or GCC-4.8 x86 distributions.

Documentation includes a complete user guide for this release of the 
Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler and Linker.

Please send all questions about this release, including documentation requests,
to sdllvm.support@qualcomm.com.

The following are some of the key features in the 3.8 version compared to the
3.7 version:

1. Full support for building Android code base (AOSP) as well as QC Android
without any changes to the build system.

2. Availability of all features from the llvm.org 3.8 release, including
developmental support for half float.

2. Integration with Symphony (previously known as MARE) to enable users to use
an alternative Auto par runtime system. Please refer to section 4.5.1 of the
Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler user guide.

Basic Usage & Examples:

clang and clang++ are the C and C++ drivers respectively of Snapdragon
LLVM ARM Compiler. They require users to specify the assembler and linker
explicitly.

For Linux:

Note that the Linux version of clang is built with support for using GCC 4.9.0
sysroot by default. Users can use a different sysroot (such as GCC-4.8 sysroot)
by using the --sysroot option as described in section 3.8 of the Snapdragon ARM
LLVM Compiler guide. 

Examples of clang driver usage on Linux:
clang -march=armv7-a -mfloat-abi=softfp -mfpu=neon -O3 -o foo foo.c
clang++ -mcpu=krait -mfloat-abi=softfp -mfpu=neon -Os -mthumb -o bar bar.cpp
clang++ -mcpu=krait -mfloat-abi=softfp -mfpu=neon \
--sysroot=</path/to/another-gcc-sysroot> -Ofast -c test.cpp

For Android:

For generating executables that can be executed on ARM Linux and Android
environment, we recommend using -static linker flag to enable generation of
static executables which do not have dependence on runtime OS libraries.

Options:

To find out the most common options, please pass -help flag to the clang
driver. This will report the Snapdragon LLVM ARM specific options and
general ARM options first, before listing target independent options
available in Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler.

Compiler options for best performance:

For 64-bit applications, we recommend using "-Ofast -mcpu=cortex-a57" options
for best performance on Kryo and Cortex-a57 cores, and "-Ofast
-mcpu=cortex-a53" for best performance on Cortex-a53 cores.

For 32-bit, we recommend using the "-Ofast -mcpu=krait" options for best
performance of your application on Krait cores. For non-Krait 32-bit cores, we
recommend using the "-Ofast" option. If you would like to avoid the generation
of Krait specific instructions (hardware divide, fused-mac) to enable running
on a variety of ARMv7 cores, but still optimize for best performance on Krait
cores, we recommend the "-Ofast -march=armv7-a -mfpu=neon" options.

The -Ofast option enables several high performance optimizations such as
Auto-vectorizer. Please refer to section 3.4.19 of the Snapdragon LLVM ARM
Compiler guide for more details.

Compiler options for smallest code-size:

We recommending using the "-Osize -mthumb" options to generate the most compact
code with the Snapdragon LLVM 3.8 compiler. Please refer to section 3.4.19 for
more details on the -Osize optimization level

Compiling for AArch64:
To compile for AArch64 (ARMv8 64-bit mode), please pass the following option to
clang:
 -target aarch64-linux-gnu

Compiling for AArch32:
To compile for AArch32, please pass the following option to clang:
 -target armv8-linux-gnueabi

Note that even though AArch32 ISA is fully backward compatible with ARMv7 ISA,
there are newer instructions in AArch32 ISA compared to ARMv7 ISA.
This means that AArch32 executables cannot be executed on ARMv7 cores such
as Krait.

Please refer to section 3.4.19 of the Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler user guide to
learn about various optimization flags.

LLVM's Support for GCC command line options:

Most of the commonly used GCC options are supported by LLVM as well. A detailed
list of options supported is listed in chapter 3 of the Snapdragon LLVM ARM
Compiler User Guide.

Use and Distribution:

This release is strictly for internal distribution and should not be
distributed outside of Qualcomm. An external release is available on
QDevNet for customer access.
