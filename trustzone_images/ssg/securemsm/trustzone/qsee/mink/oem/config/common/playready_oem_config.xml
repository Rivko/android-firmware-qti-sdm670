   OEMs need to define this flag to enable check for OPL >= 270.
  
   Please note that if this flag has to be enabled then "proprietary_play_enabler_profile"
   should also be enabled.  Below are the valid/invalid combinations.
  
   (1) "proprietary_play_enabler_profile" = 0, "proprietary_opl_profile_0" = 0 (valid)
       HDCP display is controlled with regular OPL>=301 check
   (2) "proprietary_play_enabler_profile" = 1, "proprietary_opl_profile_0" = 0 (valid)
       HDCP display is blocked if play enabler object is not found in license.
   (3) "proprietary_play_enabler_profile" = 0, "proprietary_opl_profile_0" = 1 (Invalid)
       Invalid combination.  Result is same as case (1)
   (4) "proprietary_play_enabler_profile" = 1, "proprietary_opl_profile_0" = 1 (valid)
       HDCP display is blocked if OPL>=270.
  
   set "proprietary_opl_profile_0" = 1, to check for OPL >= 270 in license.
   Note: If this flag is enabled (set to one) then OPL >=270 check will act as fallback
         check in case play enabler object for HDCP display is not found in license.
         i.e., HDCP WFD gets blocked if play enabler object is not found and OPL >= 270.
  
   set "proprietary_opl_profile_0" = 0, to ignore OPL 270 check
   Note: If this flag is disabled (set to zero) then HDCP display gets blocked if play
         enabler object for HDCP display is not found in license.
